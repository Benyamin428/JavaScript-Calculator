# JavaScript-Calculator

This is a basic iPhone calculator that has been made using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. For the JavaScript I have used event handlers to listen to when a button is clicked and perform its corresponding action. The calculator works very similarly to the way the iPhone calculator works by computing basic operations/expressions.
